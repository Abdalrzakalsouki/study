# GitHub

GitHub is **NOT the same** as GIT. While GIT is software that allows you to keep track of your files, GitHub is an online software development platform that allows you to store a copy of your code online. Check the following video to learn more:

We use GitHub because of its main benefit: it allows us to freely store our code online (or `remote`, as we developers also call it). This is useful, for example, in the case that our computer crashes and our projects are lost.

The second benefit of using an online code storage is that it allows us to work together with other developers, using one central (and remote) repository. This is done using branches, which the [GIT](./git.md) section explained.

## Being safe (SSH)

SSH stands for Secure Shell and is a way of providing users a secure way of accessing (the content of) a computer over an unsecure network. Simply put, it makes the connection much more difficult to hack or intercept.

When working with online (or what you'll hear more often: `remote`) code repositories, you might be dealing with unsecure connections. In order to make the connection more secure, you have to use an **SSH key**. Similar to a real key, this digital key allows your computer to be identified by the network you're trying to access. If the connection has been made you can access and modify the contents of network.

> The concept of secure networking through use of identifiers (like an SSH key) is also known as "authentication": are you who you say you are? Authentication is a central idea within programming and you should keep it in mind. You'll also be seeing more of it later!
