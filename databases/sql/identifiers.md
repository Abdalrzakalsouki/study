# Whatâ€™s an identifier (keys)?

A key or identifier is a single or combination of multiple fields in a table which is used to fetch or retrieve records/data-rows from data table according to the condition/requirement.

Keys are also used to create a relationship among different database tables or views.

## Primary Key

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

To define a Primary Key while creating the table, you should determine the attribute in Column definition part:

```sql
CREATE TABLE teachers (
      teacher_number INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      date_of_birth DATE,
      subject TEXT,
      email VARCHAR(200),
      PRIMARY KEY (teacher_number)
);
```

If you already have the table, and you just want to change a column to Primary Key:

```sql
ALTER TABLE teachers ADD PRIMARY KEY (teacher_number);
```

## Foreign Key

A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together. This KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

To define a Foreign Key while creating the table, you can use the below query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_number INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    teacher_id INT,
    email VARCHAR(200),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_number),
    FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(teacher_number)
);
```

A foreign key does two useful things;

- It will verify if the related record exists, so you can't insert a row referencing a non-existing relation.
- It will create an index on this column, giving faster results when querying on the particular column.

or you can add a foreign key later:

```sql
ALTER TABLE students
    ADD CONSTRAINT FK_TEACHER FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(teacher_number);
```

## Unique key

The unique key is quite similar to a primary key, they both serve to check the uniqueness of a column value.
The difference is that there can be only a single primary key, to define the record, and multiple unique keys, to define unique values.
Columns with a unique constraint can be null unlike primary keys.
Foreign keys can only reference primary keys and not unique keys.

```sql
ALTER TABLE teachers ADD UNIQUE KEY (email);
```

## Composite Key

A composite key is a key composed of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify
each row in the table when the columns are combined **uniqueness is guaranteed**, but when it taken individually
it does not guarantee uniqueness.

For example in a database with students from several schools you'd expect the same `student_number` across schools.

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_number INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    school_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_number, school_id)
);
```

Although composite keys show up in theoretical examples it isn't common to use them in practice.
Most frameworks will add an `id` column or a prefixed id column like `student_id`
