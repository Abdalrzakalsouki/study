# Whatâ€™s domain modeling?

Domain Modeling is a way to describe and model real world entities and the relationships between them, which collectively describe the problem domain space.

Derived from an understanding of system-level requirements, identifying domain entities and their relationships provides an effective basis for understanding and helps practitioners design systems for maintainability testability, and incremental development.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) are used widely in domain modeling. In this diagram, **entities** are showing by boxes and are connected to each other with a line (**relationships**).

An example of ER diagrams are shown below:
